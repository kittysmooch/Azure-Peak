// /datum/action/cooldown/spell - Ported from Vanderlin
// This is the new spell system built on top of /datum/action/cooldown.
// We'll gradually move spells over to this new system to complete the job of nuking proc holder from our codebase
// Adapted for AP. No Mana or Attunement system because imo, 
// Attunement causes balance issues by varying effectiveness of spell dramatically based on caster's attunement
// And Mana is not necessary because we are going to stick with using blue / green bar to balance instead of a third bar and forcing long out of combat rest time that stacks on top of sleep based rest time. Just one system to KISS.

/**
 * # The spell action
 *
 * This is the base action for how many of the game's
 * spells (and spell adjacent) abilities function.
 * These spells function off of a cooldown-based system.
 *
 * ## Pre-spell checks:
 * - [can_cast_spell][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/can_cast_spell] checks if the OWNER
 * of the spell is able to cast the spell.
 * - [is_valid_target][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/is_valid_target] checks if the TARGET
 * THE SPELL IS BEING CAST ON is a valid target for the spell. NOTE: The CAST TARGET is often THE SAME as THE OWNER OF THE SPELL,
 * but is not always - depending on how [Pre Activate][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/PreActivate] is resolved.
 * - [can_invoke][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/can_invoke] is run in can_cast_spell to check if
 * the OWNER of the spell is able to say the current invocation.
 *
 * ## The spell chain:
 * - [before_cast][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/before_cast] is the last chance for being able
 * to interrupt a spell cast. This returns a bitflag. if SPELL_CANCEL_CAST is set, the spell will not continue.
 * - [spell_feedback][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/spell_feedback] is called right before cast, and handles
 * invocation and sound effects. Overridable, if you want a special method of invocation or sound effects,
 * or you want your spell to handle invocation / sound via special means.
 * - [cast][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/cast] is where the brunt of the spell effects should be done
 * and implemented.
 * - [after_cast][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/after_cast] is the aftermath - final effects that follow
 * the main cast of the spell. By now, the spell cooldown has already started
 *
 * ## Other procs called / may be called within the chain:
 * - [invocation][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/invocation] handles saying any vocal (or emotive) invocations the spell
 * may have, and can be overriden or extended. Called by spell_feedback.
 * - [reset_spell_cooldown][/datum/action/cooldown/spell/reset_spell_cooldown] is a way to handle reverting a spell's
 * cooldown and making it ready again if it fails to go off at any point. Not called anywhere by default. If you
 * want to cancel a spell in before_cast and would like the cooldown restart, call this.
