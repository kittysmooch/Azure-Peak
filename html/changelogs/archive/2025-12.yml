  - balance: The priestly robes that Bishops and the like get are now fireproof.
  PatapoIIIa:
  - bugfix: Items that are explicitly blocked from being used as ingredients (e.g.,
      full storage bags, written paper, etc.) will no longer be consumed when performing
      multi-quantity crafting.
  - code_imp: Synchronized the item consumption logic with the `can_craft_with()`
      check, making the crafting system more robust against complex item states.

  NewyearnewmeUwu:
  - bugfix: chaining people after walking away is no longer possible
  PatapoIIIa:
  - balance: Fixed an exploit that allowed infinite experience gain by repeatedly
      reinserting and retrieving a single ingot from a lit furnace.
  - bugfix: Ingot items now correctly reset their 'smelted' status when placed back
      into a furnace, requiring a full smelting cycle for new experience gain.
  - code_imp: Updated `add_item` logic for smelters.
  - bugfix: Fixed the "type masquerade" issue for crafted long pipes, which previously
      caused them to have flickering sprites and break after cleaning.
  - bugfix: Fixed a bug where crafted pipes would start with residual "ashes".
  mazzinsanity:
  - rscadd: Added new stat roll emotes
