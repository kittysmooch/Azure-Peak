changes:
  - balance: "Fixed an exploit that allowed infinite experience gain by repeatedly reinserting and retrieving a single ingot from a lit furnace."
  - bugfix: "Ingot items now correctly reset their 'smelted' status when placed back into a furnace, requiring a full smelting cycle for new experience gain."
  - code_imp: "Updated `add_item` logic for smelters."
